# A.I-Bot
 A not very smart but under development A.I

This is my simple A.I bot inspired by my sister. Its stil under development. However I decided to release its first version.

You will need following modules specially for this-:
SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, wikipedia, youtube-search-python and pafy.

Also Python<= 3.6 is required.

Just run the ```__main__.py``` file in terminal and it will work. However, if you want to use the email function,
you will need to provide ur email address and password manually in __main.py__.

The list of accepted commands can be found by saying help command.

See you in next update, until then bye.
